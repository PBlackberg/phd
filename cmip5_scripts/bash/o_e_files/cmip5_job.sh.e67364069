/g/data/k10/cb4968/phd/cmip5_scripts/cmip5_metrics/funcs/vars/myPlots.py:17: RuntimeWarning: More than 20 figures have been opened. Figures created through the pyplot interface (`matplotlib.pyplot.figure`) are retained until explicitly closed and may consume too much memory. (To control this warning, see the rcParam `figure.max_open_warning`).
